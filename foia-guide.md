# FOIA guide
This guide will teach you how to obtain information from governmental agencies in Chicago and Illinois through the "Freedom of Information Act" process. 
## What is FOIA?
The Freedom of Information Act (also called Freedom of Information Law in other states) defines what information the public has the right to access, how they can access the information, and what exceptions government agencies can take in refusing to release the information.
## Getting started
### First things first
- Every FOIA request must include your name, address, and telephone number. 
- Consider that the agency won't create a dataset/document/informative publication to respond to your request. You can only ask for existing information.
### How to send a FOIA request
1. Know where to send your FOIA request. This is sometimes the trickiest part because the agency that has the data you seek is unlikely to say anywhere what data it has. See [data sources] below. 
2. Write your request in a detailed narrative form. This is the second trickiest part because you have no idea who is giong to read your request and how they will understand it. You may receive data you didn't want, or none at all. 
3. Fax, email, or mail your request. You will receive a response of some kind within 5 days (the law doesn't specifcy business versus all days). 

### How to write a good request
Write your request as if you were sending a letter to a friend asking them for a favor and in which every letter sent by both of you is expensive. Plus, your friend doesn't have a phone or online chat, otherwise you could simply chat with them and answer any questions they had quickly. 

Your request should clearly state what information you want, for which period, and in which format. Ask nicely!

#### Example requests
To Department of Finance: I would like to have an Excel spreadsheet that shows the number of citations issued for parking in the bike lane, which is a violation of Municipal Code 9-40-060, per month for the years 2005-2012. 
## Agencies and the data they have (sources)
### City of Chicago and sister agencies
- Chicago Public Schools
- Chicago Transit Authority - information on contracts
- Chicago Department of Transportation
- Chicago Department of Finance - parking tickets
- Chicago Department of Administrative Hearings - other citations, the number of citations refuted by the cited
## Dealing with unexpected responses
Sometimes you will receive a response saying that the data doesn't exist, or that it's cumbersome for the agency to release to you, or that it will cost money, and therefore you are not receiving the information for which you asked. 

Don't worry as there are many remedies! The first thing you should is try to get the FOIA officer on the phone to see if you can resolve this without having to respond formally via fax, email, or mail. Your conversation should focus on whether or not the information you asked for really does exist, and how it exists (is it in a database or a stack of papers?). When you understand this, you can file a revised request (it's best to stick to the formal FOIA method because this forces the responding agency to follow the FOIA law).
## Who to contact if you have a problem
If you feel an agency is not responding in a timely way or not responding with information you believe they have and is subject to public relase, contact the Illinois attorney general's office. 

The state legislature has recently created the position of Public Access Counselor whose job is to ensure the public's access to information subject under FOIA.
