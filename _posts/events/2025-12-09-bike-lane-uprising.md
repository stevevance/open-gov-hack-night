[Bike Lane Uprising](https://bikelaneuprising.com/) has conducted a data-driven audit and risk analysis of over 50,000 Illinois companies registered with the United States Department of Transportation - specifically examining their risk of involvement in crashes and fatalities with bicyclists.

Bike Lane Uprising maintains a mobile app that allows bicyclists to report bikeway infractions. This report out will highlight the correlation they have found between companies who obstruct bike lanes and them being involved in a crash or fatality with a bicyclist.  The goal of this audit is to examine predictive patterns of companies most at risk and identify opportunities to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.

This report out will cover:

 - Which Illinois-based USDOT-registered companies have been involved in bicyclist related crashes and/or fatalities?
 - What insights can be found from these crashes?
 - Where do these crashes take place?
 - What % of bike-related crashes involved a company also reported to Bike Lane Uprising for obstructing bike lanes?
 - Who insures these carriers?
 - What percent of these companies are vendors of the City of Chicago?
    - How dollar amount are the contracts?
    - How many contracts have they had with the city?
    - What are the contracts for?
