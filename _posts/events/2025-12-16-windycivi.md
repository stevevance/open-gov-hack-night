We'll be hearing from one of our very own breakout groups - [Govbot (formerly WindyCivi)](https://windycivi.com)! 

Legislative data is hard to parse, track, and organize—and existing solutions can disappear overnight, like Google’s Civic Information API did in 2024. What would a decentralized, open-source alternative look like?

Govbot offers three components:
- a decentralized data catalog, including legislative data from all 50 states and territories
- a framework for an efficient private AI model to tag bills based on topic,
-  frameworks for using the data in various ways: analyze it with SQL via DuckDB, visualize it with a custom website, or automate it using social media bots.

Built on forever-free tools, Govbot gives activists, journalists, and citizens the framework to track and analyze legislation without dependence on centralized platforms.
