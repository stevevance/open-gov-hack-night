The idea of the urban *neighborhood* – and how to measure and delineate such neighborhoods – has long been of interest to residents, planners, and scholars. Dr. Crystal Bae will describe the Chicago Neighborhood Project (CNP), a recent effort with Dr. Lydia Wileden and Dr. Emily Talen to map Chicago neighborhoods and pose related questions about the analysis of crowdsourced neighborhood boundary drawings. To gain insight into shared representations of Chicago neighborhoods and their relationship to existing administrative boundaries such as Chicago’s Community Areas, the researchers invited Chicago residents to draw their neighborhood boundaries using an online mapping interface. The goal of CNP is to examine variation in how neighborhoods are defined by residents and use that variation to inform how policymakers, planners, and researchers create, implement, and measure place-based policies. 

The project collected a large sample of neighborhood map drawings using a crowdsourced approach, recruiting responses via email to community groups, social media, targeted web advertisements, flyering, collaborations with news media, and word of mouth. In this talk, the team describes the data collection methodology, resulting in over 5,000 responses, as well as initial stages of data cleaning and analysis. Dr. Bae will present early findings and views of the data from the project in relation to methodological approaches to understanding Chicago residents' cognitive boundaries of the neighborhood. New responses are still being collected, so the team welcomes additional submissions through the project website at [chicago-neighborhoods.com](https://chicago-neighborhoods.com).
