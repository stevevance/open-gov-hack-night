One year into the federal administration, the civic tech landscape has been fundamentally reshaped by radical shifts in policy, massive personnel changes, and a re-evaluation of how technology serves—or surveils—the public. While the initial shocks of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have settled into a new, often grueling reality, the community remains committed to building a government that is effective, transparent, and human-centered. This reflection isn't just about the numbers; it's about the people on the front lines and the ethics of what comes next. 

Join Reilly Martin from Technologists for the Public Good, Kate Green from We The Builders, and Christopher Whitaker from the Alliance of Civic Technology for a panel discussion on what the last year has meant for civic tech.
