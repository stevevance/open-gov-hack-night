title: "Online: The Civics of Technology Project"
description: "The Civics of Technology Project (CoT) is a grassroots education organization that conducts research, develops curriculum, and offers professional development for teachers and students to critically inquire into the effects of technology on people’s individual and collective lives. At a time when powerful Big Tech companies seek to control how, what, and why people learn with and about technology, CoT brings together educators and students from across disciplines and institutions to consider ways to resist and refuse corporate capture of classrooms while reimagining justice-oriented technology education."

The [Civics of Technology Project](https://www.civicsoftechnology.org/) (CoT) is a grassroots education organization that conducts research, develops curriculum, and offers professional development for teachers and students to critically inquire into the effects of technology on people’s individual and collective lives. At a time when powerful Big Tech companies seek to control how, what, and why people learn with and about technology, CoT brings together educators and students from across disciplines and institutions to consider ways to resist and refuse corporate capture of classrooms while reimagining justice-oriented technology education. 

CoT board member Charles Logan will provide an overview of the organization’s work, highlighting aspects that may be especially relevant for the Chi Hack Night community.
