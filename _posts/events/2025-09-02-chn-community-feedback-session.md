Join us for a facilitated group conversation about how we, as both individuals and a community, might navigate the rising authoritarian government in the US. During these times, it's important to stay informed, build community, and make plans. How might we do this better?

The facilitated discussion will be structured around the following prompts:

1. **Staying informed**: How are you staying informed with current events and news? What sources of information do you use?
2. **Building community**: How might we strengthen the Chi Hack Night Community? What are we doing well? What could we be doing better? How might we use our skills and privilege to help those that don’t have it?
3. **Making plans**: Other than voting, what plans do you have to resist authoritarianism? How do you plan to bridge information into action? See [Making a Plan by #1MExperiments](https://millionexperiments.com/zines/making-a-plan)

Community feedback will be summarized and shared out in a future blog post. Join us Tuesday at 6:00 p.m. in person!
