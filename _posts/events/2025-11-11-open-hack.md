There will be no presentation this week. Instead, we're going to have an Open Hack in person (doors open at 6pm, announcements kick off at 6:30pm). Here is our agenda:

1. Welcome and introductions
2. Socializing to meet and get to know your fellow hack night-ers
3. Announcements from Chi Hack Night and attendees
4. Breakout group pitches


**This event will be in person. We won't have a livestream component due to the open hack format, but you can follow along via slack after we kick off for how to join breakout groups! Doors open at 6pm. Announcements and going into breakouts groups will happen at 6:30pm.**

**In-person:** <a href='https://maps.app.goo.gl/YVGKhYDyqn3dkCit7'>i.c.stars, 750 N Orleans, Suite 500 (5th floor), Chicago IL</a>.
