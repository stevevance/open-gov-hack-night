  <p><strong>Chi Hack Night will be at <a href='https://www.icstars.org/location/chicago/'>i.c.stars</a></strong>, a non-profit tech training & placement program, will be hosting us at their office at 750 N Orleans Suite 500, Chicago.</p>

A vast network of new license plate cameras has exploded across Illinois in recent years—paid for by state grants to fight retail crime. With the federal government clamoring for more information on people’s movements, how worried should we be about leaving our privacy in the hands of Flock Safety?

Unraveled Press journalists Steve Held and Raven Geary will talk through the [groundbreaking reporting]() they have done on the proliferation of license plate reader cameras in Illinois, how the data from them has been mishandled and abused, and the actions state and local government have taken in response to it.

**This event will be in person. We won't have a livestream component due to the open hack format, but you can follow along via slack after we kick off for how to join breakout groups! Doors open at 6pm. Announcements and going into breakouts groups will happen at 6:30pm.**

**In-person:** <a href='https://maps.app.goo.gl/YVGKhYDyqn3dkCit7'>i.c.stars, 750 N Orleans, Suite 500 (5th floor), Chicago IL</a>.
