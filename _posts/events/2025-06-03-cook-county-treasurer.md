Presentation: **A Broken Property Tax Appeals System: How the assessment appeals system disproportionately shifts the tax burden onto homeowners in low-income, Black and Latino communities**

The Cook County property tax assessment appeals system shifted nearly $2 billion in property taxes onto homeowners from businesses over just three years, with lower-income, Black and Latino homeowners picking up a disproportionate share of the burden, according to a new study by the Cook County Treasurer’s Office.

Treasurer’s Office Researcher Christopher Silber, the study’s lead author, and Director of Research Hal Dardick, the study’s editor, will break down the background, methodology and findings of the study. In the process, they will explain how the appeals process impacts property tax bills, who did and didn’t appeal and how the process disproportionately shifts taxes onto homeowners in low-income, Black and Latino communities.
