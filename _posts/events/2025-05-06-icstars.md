  <p><em>Show and Tell</em> is our low-pressure session for anyone in the Chi Hack Night community to share what they’ve been working on or thinking about — whether it’s a <strong>breakout group update</strong>, a <strong>cool civic tech project</strong>, an <strong>idea-in-progress</strong>, or something you just started noodling on.</p>

  <p>It’s more casual than lightning talks — think <em>open mic</em> for ongoing work. All experience levels welcome!</p>

  <p><strong>Each presenter will have 5 minutes total</strong> — that’s 4 minutes to share and 1 minute for quick Q&A.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">No slides required. No pressure. But an HDMI laptop input is available if necessary. Just show up and tell us something cool. 💡</p>
