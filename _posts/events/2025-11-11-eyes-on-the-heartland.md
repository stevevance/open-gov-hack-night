A vast network of new license plate cameras has exploded across Illinois in recent years—paid for by state grants to fight retail crime. With the federal government clamoring for more information on people’s movements, how worried should we be about leaving our privacy in the hands of Flock Safety?

Unraveled Press journalists Steve Held and Raven Geary will talk through the [groundbreaking reporting]() they have done on the proliferation of license plate reader cameras in Illinois, how the data from them has been mishandled and abused, and the actions state and local government have taken in response to it.

**This event will be in person, but you can also tune in via livestream. Doors open at 6pm. The livestream and announcements will start around 6:30pm CDT.**

**In-person:** <a href='https://maps.app.goo.gl/YVGKhYDyqn3dkCit7'>i.c.stars, 750 N Orleans, Suite 500 (5th floor), Chicago IL</a>.
