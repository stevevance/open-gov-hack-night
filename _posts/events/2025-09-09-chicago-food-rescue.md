[Chicago Food Rescue](https://www.chicagofoodrescue.org/) bridges the gap between food waste and food insecurity in Chicago. Volunteers use an app to deliver surplus food that would otherwise be thrown out directly to organizations serving people in need. Food Rescue makes nutritious food accessible to people facing food insecurity while giving volunteers a flexible, meaningful way to contribute.

The need is urgent: one in five Chicago residents faces food insecurity, while millions of pounds of perfectly good food go to waste. Chicago Food Rescue ensures surplus food is distributed with dignity and efficiency – meeting people where they are. In less than a year, our volunteers have completed over 600 rescues and delivered more than 125,000 pounds of food to local community organizations.

These efforts also provide powerful environmental benefits. By diverting food from landfills, Chicago Food Rescue has already prevented the equivalent of 415,000 car miles worth of CO₂ emissions. In doing so, the organization presents a clear win-win for food justice and sustainability—reshaping how communities access food while protecting the planet.
