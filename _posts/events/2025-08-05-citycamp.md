[CityCamp](https://citycamp.com/) is an “unconference” designed to bring together technologists, nonprofit leaders, and local government stakeholders to collaborate on innovative ways to improve our cities. It’s participant-driven, rather than speaker-driven, so the public shapes the agenda. This fall, Alliance of Civic Technologists’ member organizations will be hosting a series of CityCamp events across the country, leading up to World CityCamp Day on September 20, 2025.


The first CityCamp was held in January 2010, in Chicago, Illinois. It was then established as an open source brand so that anyone could host events anywhere. Since then, there have been self-organized CityCamp events worldwide. Anyone can host a CityCamp - membership with the Alliance of Civic Technologists is not required. 


The following locations have CityCamps planned for this fall - join in or learn more about hosting your own at citycamp.com
- New York City
- Atlanta, GA
- Gainesville, FL
- Lafayette, CA
- San Francisco, CA
- Eugene, OR
