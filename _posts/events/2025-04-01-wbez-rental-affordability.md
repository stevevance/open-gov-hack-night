title: "Online: Rental Affordability in Chicago"
description: "Rents have risen faster than incomes in Chicago in recent decades, leading to worsening rental affordability issues for residents across the city. Between 2000 and 2022, the number of neighborhoods considered “affordable” for low- and middle-income renters decreased, and the number of new units has fallen. Amy Qin and Andjela Padejski have been analyzing these and other rental affordability issues in Chicago for recent reporting in WBEZ. They and their colleagues also created a Chicago Rent Time Machine to allow readers to explore historical rent data. In this presentation, they will discuss their reporting process and findings."
speakers:
 - Amy Qin, Data Reporter

Rents have risen faster than incomes in Chicago in recent decades, leading to worsening rental affordability issues for residents across the city. Between 2000 and 2022, the number of neighborhoods considered "affordable" for low- and middle-income renters decreased, and the number of new units has fallen.

Amy Qin and Andjela Padejski have been analyzing these and other rental affordability issues in Chicago for [recent reporting in WBEZ](https://www.wbez.org/housing/2025/02/26/chicago-rents-are-rising-fast-for-many-theres-nowhere-left-to-go). They and their colleagues also created a [Chicago Rent Time Machine](https://www.wbez.org/interactive/chicago-rents-climbing-fast-housing-crisis/chicago-rent-time-machine/) to allow readers to explore historical rent data. In this presentation, they will discuss their reporting process and findings.
