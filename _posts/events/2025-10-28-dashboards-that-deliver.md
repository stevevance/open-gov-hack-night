When writing Dashboards That Deliver, the authors surveyed over 450 dashboard creators and asked a big picture question: do you agree with the statement ‘most dashboards fail’? More than 70% of the respondents agreed, and that’s among people with a vested interest in seeing dashboards succeed.

The secret to designing a dashboard that has an impact? Start with understanding your users deeply, then design with them as partners. Today, dashboards are analytical products, where the design process has more in common with software development than the data communications models used for designing charts to communicate a data story.

During this talk, you’ll learn the Dashboards That Deliver design framework, which blends user-centered design, Agile, and data viz practices and the authors’ experiences designing thousands of dashboards across industries. Then we’ll dive into a few practical examples, including Amanda’s stories about her own dashboards and examples from the book, to see how the framework applies in practice, and what lessons you can apply to the next data product you collaborate on, whether you’re a team of one or an enterprise analytics team.
