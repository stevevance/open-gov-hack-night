 A “ghost bus” is a bus that has a countdown to its arrival, but it never shows up. It’s frustrating: people need to get to work on time and don’t want to wait in the cold any longer than they have to. Riders deserve real-time information they can trust. 

The Chicago Transit Authority has been working on improvements. A cross-functional team including Customer Information, IT, and Planning & Innovation has been upgrading technology and procedures so that riders get better data. 

This talk will explain the upgrades, what we’re working on next, and how you can use newly-available bus cancelation data in your app.
