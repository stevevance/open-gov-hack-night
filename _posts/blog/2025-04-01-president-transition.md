After two years as President, Sean Watland is stepping down and will be succeeded by Sneha Jalukar and Samantha Goodman. Sean will remain on the Board of Directors for the remainder of his Board seat term. 

I am so grateful for my time serving as President of Chi Hack Night. Over the past two years, I am proud to see how much our organization has grown - not only in growing attendance but in how we have embraced change as a community as well. I have so much gratitude for our Board of Directors (past and present) for how much work they have put into making this organization a little bit better every day. Thank you all for embracing change and working hard with me over these years! 

Lastly, I want to thank all our whole community for making this place as special as it is. None of what we do could be possible without you all. 

I am thrilled to introduce our new incoming Co-Presidents, Sneha Jalukar and Samantha Goodman, as I know they will certainly do great things for our organization!

_Sneha Section goes here!_

Samantha is a long-time Chi Hack Night attendee and volunteer, and has served on the Board for the past year. She hopes to continue to shepherd a positive and welcoming atmosphere at Chi Hack Night and grow its membership. 

The fact that Chi Hack Night has endured so long is a testament to the dedication of the many volunteers, as well as the need for a space to work, learn and collaborate together. Looking forward to 2025 and the uncertainty that we’re all facing, it’s doubly important to maintain and grow our community. There are many things I love about Chi Hack Night that I want to preserve, but also want to be flexible and respond to changes as needed. 

Working with Sneha is going to be great - we’re both very dedicated to Chi Hack Night and I look forward to collaborating with her. Since this is a volunteer position we figured there is no reason not to split the duties, work together and get things done as a duo instead of one person completing everything alone. Here’s to a collaborative and wonderful term as co-presidents!
